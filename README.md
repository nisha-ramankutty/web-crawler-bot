# web-crawler-bot
This project is about building a web crawler CLI using node js. It accepts an input URL and a depth number. The crawler will scan through images in the given URL and stores their links in a json file. The loop is iterated for the depth value provided. Crawler also scans for hyperlinks in the url and continue to every links inside that page.
